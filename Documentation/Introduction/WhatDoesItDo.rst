What does it do?
================

In the digital age, enterprises and citizens should be able to ask for an administrative
authorization or an official register extract electronically. Thanks to the eGov CH Reference
project, they can access any useful information online 24/7 and order via internet or mobile phone.
The administration better responds to current requirements and customer needs, helping to reduce
bureaucracy and increasing the attractiveness of the Swiss economy.

The eGov API extension aims at providing an easy way to swiss public authorities to show and grant
access to the different administrative services they offer through their TYPO3 website.
