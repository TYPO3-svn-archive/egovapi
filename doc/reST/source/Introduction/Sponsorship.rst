Sponsorship
===========

This extension is the official implementation of the swiss eGov Remote API for TYPO3. It has been
sponsored by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs SECO which is the Confederation's competence
centre for all core issues relating to economic policy. The SECO wanted to improve the online access
to the administrative services they offer. This project has been developed and is being maintained
by Causal Sàrl, in Fribourg.
