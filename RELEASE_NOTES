************************************************************************
CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS between egovapi 1.3 and 1.4
(for technical details see ChangeLog)
************************************************************************

=== Web Service ===

	Support for different versions of the web service has been
	added. This influences the web service end-point.
	Search for line
	$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['EXT']['extConf']['egovapi']
	within typo3conf/localconf.php and remove it. Then enter
	Extension Manager (EM) and reconfigure default settings of this
	extension. This will ensure you have a clean global configuration.

	If this is not an option for you, you really should clear the
	WSDL URI in the advanced configuration.

=== Configuration ===

	Support for eCHmunicipalityID has finally been dropped. Please
	use eCHcommunityID instead, as stated in the deprecation log.

=== Templates ===

	Selector form template has been updated to show a drop-down menu
	to select the version instead of a simple textbox. Associated
	behavior script (Resources/Public/JavaScript/selector.js) changed
	as well to accomodate this modification.

	Due to changes in the underlying web service for both v1 and v2,
	following service contact fields were changed in the data model
	and in the templates:

	- 'phone1' has been renamed to 'phone'
	- 'phone2' has been removed (it never got implemented)
	- 'municipality' has been renamed to 'locality'

=== Domain Model ===

	To accomodate changes in the web service, the domain model has
	been updated.

	tx_egovapi_domain_model_block_fee fields were changed:
	- DELETED: content
	- ADDED: description, pricings

=== Localization ===

	Localization files are not included anymore in the extension. Only
	English (default language) is part of the release. French, German
	and Italian are retrieved from the TYPO3 Extension Manager as
	language packages. Typos in labels may be fixed by contributing on
	http://translation.typo3.org/projects/TYPO3.TYPO3.ext.egovapi/



************************************************************************
CHANGES & IMPROVEMENTS between egovapi 1.2 and 1.3
(for technical details see ChangeLog)
************************************************************************

=== Requirements ===

	TYPO3 4.3 is not supported anymore (officially deprecated on
	http://typo3.org/download/packages/ since 2011/01/26 with the release
	of TYPO3 4.5 LTS). Supported versions of TYPO3 now starts with 4.4.0.

=== Templates ===

	In order to have microformat-enabled office address block (block #13),
	following templates have been updated with changes in the HTML markup
	and structure:

	- Resources/Private/Templates/Fluid/Service/Single.html
	- Resources/Private/Templates/Standard/Service.html

	Disclaimer: In an attempt to stay backward-compatible, all but the
	tx_egovapi_block_contact_pcl have been kept as additional classes to
	the HTML structure.

	How to update your custom CSS if you want to get rid of useless classes
	while adding microformat support to your address block:

	----------------------------------------+-------------------------------
	Old class                               | New class
	----------------------------------------+-------------------------------
	tx_egovapi_block_contact_office         | organization-name
	tx_egovapi_block_contact_department     | organization-unit
	tx_egovapi_block_contact_address        | adr / street-address
	tx_egovapi_block_contact_pcl            | -
	tx_egovapi_block_contact_postalCode     | postal-code
	tx_egovapi_block_contact_municipality   | locality
	----------------------------------------+-------------------------------

	This update is of course only needed if you used the default templates.
	If you created your own templates, the markers and subparts did not
	change and you will not have to update anything.

=== Services ===

	Format of the list of blocks in the URL changed. In versions prior to
	1.3.0, block numbers were separated by spaces ("+" when URL-encoded):

	blocks=1+2+3+4+5+6+10+11+12+13

	They are now separated by commas instead:

	blocks=1,2,3,4,5,6,10,11,12,13

	Furthermore, ranges of blocks may be specified (and default TypoScript
	configuration does it when generating links with the selector form
	plugin - pi2):

	blocks=1-6,10-13

	This change should be completely transparent as long as you only use
	version 1.3 of this extension. A typical problem would be to use egovapi
	1.3 for the selector form and, on another website, egovapi 1.2 to show
	the service details.

	If this cannot be prevented:

	- Make sure to deactivate shortening of the list of blocks by removing
 	  stdWrap preUserFunc = tx_egovapi_utility_ts->contractList
	- Dynamically change commas into spaces based on the following snippet:

	10 = TEXT
	10.data = GP:blocks
	10.split {
	    token.char = 44
	    cObjNum = 1 |*| 1 |*| 2
	    1.current = 1
	    1.wrap = |+
	    2.current = 1
	}
	10.wrap = &blocks=|


	Services are now grouped by provider ("Commune", "Confédération", ...)
	and the providers are alphabetically sorted. If this does not fit your
	needs, you may implement hook
	$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTCONF']['egovapi']['ajaxHook']
	to post-process the list of services and reorder them as you want. See
	http://forge.typo3.org/issues/27577 for sample hook implementation.
